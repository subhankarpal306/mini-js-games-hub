## 🛠️ How to Add a New Game

1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Create a folder** for your game under `/games/` (e.g., `/games/snake/`).  
3. Inside that folder, create:
   ```
   index.html
   style.css
   script.js
   ```
4. Add your game to the `games` array in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   const games = [
     // ... existing games ...
     {
       name: "Your Game Name",
       path: "games/yourgame/index.html",
     },
   ];
   ```

5. Ensure your game appears automatically on the main page.
6. **Create an issue** first describing the game you want to add and wait for it to be assigned to you.
7. **Commit and push** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Your Game Name 🎮"
   git push origin main
   ```
8. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** and describe your game, referencing the issue number.
